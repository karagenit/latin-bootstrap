# Latin Final Project

Latin Translator, built with Whitaker's Words, jQuery, & Bootstrap

## The Original App

The idea for this project came from a website called [Whitaker's Words](http://archives.nd.edu/words.html). While it's an incredibly useful app, I had a couple issues with it:

#### It's Old

While this isn't inherently bad, it's a console application written in Ada that uses a Perl script to make the web interface (the Perl takes a query from the user and runs the Ada application with the parameters, then shows the output). I don't like this because:

1. It wasn't designed for the web
2. Old, uncommon languages are hard to maintain

#### It's Slow

Not so much that the actual computation takes a long time - the Ada application is pretty good (I haven't run any speed tests to compare the Ada to the PHP script I wrote, I hope to do that in the future). The issue was having to *click* search and *click* back for every search query (I know, I know, my life is so tough ... I'm lazy okay?) - I wanted to make a webpage that used AJAX to update search results on-the-fly.

#### It's Ugly

Oh yeah, and it looks pretty 00's, so I figured I'd give it a facelift by using Bootstrap to design the page.
